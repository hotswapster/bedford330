An electronic monitor for engine and auxiliaries. 

Old impulse and capillary type sensors and instruments can be replaced with electric senders. The arduino will act as a data aquisition device and pass information on to the original dash, a simple 16 x 2 character display and a Raspberry Pi.

The Raspberry Pi will have a touch screen and will be the main interface. The 16x2 character display is for a backup if the PI or the Smart Display fail, and will be hidden unless required.

The Raspberry Pi with Smart Display will eventually have a reversing camera and house battery information tied into it.
